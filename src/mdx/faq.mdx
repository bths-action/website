### What makes this club different from other clubs?
We are a club that doesn't aim to strip your pockets of any money and encourages real work and education to help the community. We do not accept money as payment for credits and hours, as that is bribery and corruption.
Also, we have a website that is updated regularly and has powerful features, that surpasses the old deprecated Google Forms and Sheets.
